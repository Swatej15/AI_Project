# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) — SA & GA

### This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as part of an AI coursework project.

# Install required dependencies:
pip install numpy, pandas, matplotlib,time

numpy → numerical operations, permutations

pandas → CSV loading and tables

matplotlib → plots and route visualisation

time → built-in Python library (no install needed)

notebook → to open .ipynb file

# Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook SA_GA_Solving.ipynb

# Run all cells sequentially to execute:

Data loading
Simulated Annealing
Genetic Algorithm
Visualizations and comparisons
